# Place Matters Toolkit

The Place Matters Toolkit is a guidebook to help you identify, promote, and protect places that you care about. The toolkit was originally created and published by the [Place Matters program](http://placematters.net/) of City Lore in New York City. In June 2016, Baltimore Heritage started working with Place Matters staff and preservation advocates to revise and expand the toolkit to create a new open educational resource for the [Local Preservaton School](https://localpreservation.github.io).

## What is the Local Preservation School?

The Local Preservation School is an **open learning environment** where preservation advocates and volunteers share with people how to save and sustain historic places in their communities. Our goal is to teach you how to get involved with historic preservation in your community through free online courses, easy-to-use tutorials and fun projects. **Beginners are welcome!**
