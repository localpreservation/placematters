Once you collect your stories, and identify and develop your themes, you will want to present them to the public to promote and advocate for your place. The value of a place is rarely so obvious that it can't benefit from vibrant interpretation. Educational products such as exhibits, tours, and films are often said to be "interpretive" because they interpret, or choose, the most significant things to say about a topic.

This section includes information on presentations that:

- Promote research;
- Convey information;
- Are relatively time and cost effective;
- Take advantage of existing outreach and publicity opportunities.

In considering these (and other) strategies for making the significance of your place known to a wider public, consider your goals, budget, interests, and the mix of skills, materials and so on that you have to work with.
