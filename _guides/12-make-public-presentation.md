*Sharing the fruits of your research in public helps build interest and attract supporters.*

You've put a lot of time and energy into researching your place and
creating a place profile. Now it's time to convey in public the
information you've gathered and prepared. This is a key step in
educating others about why your place matters, and advocating for it in
the face of threats.

Possibilities for public program formats include:

- Panels with a mix of academic and community scholars, and people with first-hand testimony to share
- Public conversations between interviewer and interviewee
- Conversation combined with a performance (theatrical, musical, etc.) that enhances learning about the topic;
- Dramatized retelling of events
- Tour(s) of the site led by "insiders"
- Any other format you can imagine that suits your audience and your goals

### Using the Internet as a Presentation Format

Another way to make a public presentation about your place is to put it online, where people can access it at any time, reference it after you make public presentations, and link to it from their own online materials. The ways to put something online are too numerous to include here. But if you want to do it, and don't already know how to do so, put the word out to other stakeholders who care about the place, and keep your ears open as you meet with different people. Chances are someone with both the skills for putting information online and enthusiasm about your place will appear.
