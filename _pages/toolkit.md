The Place Matters Toolkit is a guidebook to help you identify, promote, and protect places that you care about. We expect the Toolkit to evolve as we develop and post new material. Let us know if you have ideas for new topics, or if a topic covered here requires more explanation.

1. [About the toolkit](/placematters/about/)
2. [Defining your project](/placematters/defining-your-project/)
3. [Explaining your place](/placematters/explaining-your-place/)
4. [Presenting your place](/placematters/presenting-your-place/)
5. [Protecting your place](/placematters/protecting-your-place/)

This Toolkit was made possible with support from the J.M. Kaplan Fund and the New York Community Trust. Originally published on the [Place Matters website](http://placematters.net/node/13), this version of the toolkit is maintained by the [Local Preservation School](http://localpreservation.github.io/) and published under a [Creative Commons Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) with permission from City Lore and Marci Reaven.
